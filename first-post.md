## Welcome!































Hello, and welcome to [Affirm](http://www.affirm.io)!  I created Affirm after struggling to find a blogging service that did everything I wanted it to do.  Affirm gives you complete ownership of your content (you can even link your github repo!), a streamlined interface, and the ability to customize everything.































Posts are written in Markdown, which is an awesome alternative to WYSIWYG editors.  Markdown is elegant and fast to learn.  Look at the [documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for more info, or check out our cheatsheet when editing a post.































## Questions?































If you have any questions or suggestions, I would love to hear them.  Email me at vik@equirio.com, or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VikParuchuri).
